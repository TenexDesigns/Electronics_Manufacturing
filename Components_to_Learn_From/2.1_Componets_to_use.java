The following tools and equipment are recommended for self-learning electronics:

* **Soldering iron and solder:** This is essential for assembling electronic circuits.
* **Multimeter:** This is used to measure voltage, current, and resistance.
* **Oscilloscope:** This is used to view the waveforms of electronic signals.
* **Breadboard:** This is used to prototype electronic circuits without having to solder them permanently.
* **Jumper wires:** These are used to connect components on a breadboard.
* **Component tester:** This is used to test the functionality of electronic components.
* **Digital multimeter:** This is a more advanced multimeter that can measure a wider range of parameters, such as capacitance, inductance, and temperature.
* **Logic analyzer:** This is used to capture and analyze digital signals.
* **Pick-and-place machine:** This is used to automatically place components onto PCBs.
* **Reflow soldering oven:** This is used to solder components onto PCBs.
* **Test fixture:** This is used to test electronic products.

You can start with a basic set of tools and equipment, and then add more tools and equipment as your skills and knowledge develop.

Here are some additional tools and equipment that you may find helpful:

* **Drill press:** This can be used to drill holes in PCBs and other materials.
* **Heat gun:** This can be used to remove solder and shrink tubing.
* **Wire strippers:** This can be used to strip the insulation off of wires.
* **Wire cutters:** This can be used to cut wires.
* **Desoldering pump:** This can be used to remove solder from PCBs.
* **Flux pen:** This can be used to help solder flow more smoothly.
* **Soldering fume extractor:** This can help to reduce the amount of fumes produced from soldering.

You can find many of these tools and equipment at electronics stores or online retailers.
