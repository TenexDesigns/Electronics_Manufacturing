To get started with self-learning in electronics manufacturing, you'll need a variety of tools and equipment. Here are some essential ones:

1. **Soldering Iron:** This is used to join electronic components together by melting solder or lead into spaces between the components [Source 3](https://www.circuitbasics.com/electronic-tools-and-equipment/).

2. **Hot Glue Gun:** This is used to fix or protect circuits. It's important to note that you should avoid using hot glue on thermally sensitive components or plastic parts, as it may cause damage due to the heat [Source 3](https://www.circuitbasics.com/electronic-tools-and-equipment/).

3. **Wire Strippers:** These are used to strip off the insulator from a wire before it's connected to another wire or soldered [Source 4](https://deltaregis.com/2021/01/15/8-important-tools-for-the-electronics-manufacturing-production-line/).

4. **Multimeter:** This is a versatile tool used for measuring voltage, current, and resistance in electronic circuits [Source 1](https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2022-electronics-laboratory-equipment-list-essentials).

5. **Oscilloscope:** This tool is used for observing the change of an electrical signal over time, which can be crucial for diagnosing problems in a circuit [Source 1](https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2022-electronics-laboratory-equipment-list-essentials).

6. **Power Supplies:** These provide power to your electronic circuits. A regulated DC power supply is a fundamental requirement for any electronics lab [Source 1](https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2022-electronics-laboratory-equipment-list-essentials).

7. **Function Generator:** This tool is used to generate different types of electrical waveforms over a wide range of frequencies. It's useful for testing the performance of circuits [Source 1](https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2022-electronics-laboratory-equipment-list-essentials).

8. **Precision Hand Tools:** These include tools like tweezers for handling small parts, as well as screwdrivers and wrenches for assembling and adjusting components [Source 0](https://www.oreilly.com/content/practical-electronics-tools/).

9. **PCB Holder:** This tool is used to hold the PCB while soldering or desoldering components. It helps in maintaining stability and precision during the process [Source 9](https://www.electronicsb2b.com/important-sectors/electronics-manufacturing-equipment-consumables/hand-tools-electronics-applications-becoming-smarter/).

Remember, safety should be your primary concern while using these tools. Always use tools for their intended purpose, and make sure to follow the manufacturer's safety guidelines.
