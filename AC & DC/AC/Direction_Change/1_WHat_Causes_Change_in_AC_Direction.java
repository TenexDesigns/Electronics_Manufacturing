The changing direction of current in an alternating current (AC) circuit is caused by the periodic reversal of voltage. This reversal occurs due to the way AC power is generated and distributed. Here's how it works:

1. **Generator or Power Source:** AC power is typically generated at power stations using generators. These generators produce AC voltage by rotating a coil of wire in a magnetic field, which induces an alternating voltage. The rotation of the coil is what causes the voltage to alternate.

2. **Periodic Reversal:** The voltage produced by these generators goes through a complete cycle. During one half of the cycle, the voltage has a positive polarity, and during the other half, it has a negative polarity. As a result, the direction of current flow also reverses.

3. **Frequency:** The rate at which the voltage reverses direction is called the frequency and is typically measured in hertz (Hz). In the United States, AC power has a frequency of 60 Hz, meaning the voltage changes direction 60 times per second. In many other parts of the world, the frequency is 50 Hz.

So, the key difference between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) is that in DC, the voltage and current flow in one constant direction, while in AC, the voltage and current continually switch direction, creating a sinusoidal waveform. This periodic reversal in AC allows for efficient voltage transformation and long-distance power transmission, making it the standard for most electrical power distribution systems

The difference between Direct Current (DC) and Alternating Current (AC) lies in the direction in which the electrons flow. In DC, the electrons flow in one constant direction, while in AC, the electrons keep switching directions, sometimes going forward and sometimes going backward.

The reason for this difference is in how the electric charge is generated:

1. **Direct Current (DC):** In DC, the electric charge (or voltage) is generated in such a way that it always pushes the electrons in the same direction. This is typically done by a battery or a solar cell, where a chemical reaction or photovoltaic effect creates a voltage that pushes the electrons in one direction.

2. **Alternating Current (AC):** In AC, the electric charge is generated by a generator in which a magnet is rotated inside a coil of wire. As the magnet rotates, it creates a changing magnetic field. This changing magnetic field induces a voltage in the wire that alternates in direction. This is because the direction of the induced voltage depends on the direction of the changing magnetic field, which changes as the magnet rotates. This alternating voltage pushes the electrons back and forth, creating an alternating current.

Most power grids use AC because it has significant advantages over DC for long-distance power transmission. AC voltage can be easily increased or decreased using transformers, which allows the voltage to be increased for efficient long-distance transmission and then decreased for safe use in homes and businesses.
